TODO
=========

Add rocket booster sound
Add high-score
Reset the gun cooldown timer so that we can fire

Add cooldown after death so that you dont die immediately again
Add audio that can be triggered from game object behaviour
Clean up class interfaces
Remove .init from engine, figure out nicer way to do that because it is cluttered
Refactor the demo game, write a few more demos to demonstrate simple games/effects
Move Radians to angles/ angles to radians out into helper functions
Add GameObject age (if go > age die)
Add particle effects for ship
